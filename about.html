        <h2>About our team</h2>
      <p>CHARM is a dynamic, student-driven initiative operating within the Department of Physics at the University of Turin, dedicated to advancing innovation in science education and public outreach. The group is focused on designing and implementing cutting-edge science communication strategies and engaging educational events with hands-on exhibits and immersive multimedia experiences.</p>
      <p>With an interdisciplinary team comprised of physics, chemistry, and engineering students, our team aims to bridge academic research with public engagement with accessible and compelling narratives.</p>
      <p>We firmly believe that hands-on experimental experiences are essential for fostering critical thinking skills and deepening scientific understanding. Therefore, we actively engage in science communication by narrating the stories behind scientific discoveries and illustrating the processes that underpin them.</p>
      <p>By collaborating closely with the Department’s Public Engagement and Student Orientation Committees, CHARM contributes significantly to fostering scientific curiosity, literacy, and critical thinking, aiming to inspire future generations of researchers and informed citizens.</p>

        <h2>Project summary</h2>
      <p>This project has been designed with two main objectives in mind: on one hand, the scientific analysis of the natural radioactivity of our chosen territory, the collection of geological and mineralogical samples and their subsequent analysis; on the other hand, the gathering and production of multimedia content and datasets suitable for science education and science communication purposes.</p>
      <p>We will bring along scientific and audiovisual equipment, enabling us to produce short videos in situ, showing the public the use of scientific devices (primarily RadiaCode) to gather information about the visited areas. We will also organize brief, recorded field experiments demonstrating basic principles of modern physics, formatted as Instagram reels and stories.</p>
      <p>With all the material collected using the RadiaCode and other instruments at our disposal, we plan to create a dynamic and intuitive website capable of easily visualizing the acquired data on a map. The website will provide detailed information for each geological site, including the collected samples and their emission spectra, along with photos documenting our fieldwork and short narratives describing our experiences. To enhance these contents and align with our university team’s primary mission of innovating science communication, we will employ technologies such as 3D scanning and 360-degree photography.</p>
      <p>Our scientific background (the team will consist of physics, chemistry, and computer engineering students) will enable us to create scientifically accurate content that remains accessible and understandable to the general public.</p>

        <h2>Rough timeline</h2>
      <p>The expedition has been planned around five different sites, all close to one another.</p>
      <p>We are planning to launch our campaign on the 31st of this month and hope that this timeline does not cause any issues with Radiacode’s delivery process. Please let us know if there are any foreseeable concerns or adjustments needed.</p>
      <p>The timeline has been planned across seven days to allow us to explore a single site per day, leaving lots of time to do inspections, sample collection and data analysis, all while being careful about radiation and contamination hazards.</p>
      <p>The main way of transportation we will be using is a red Fiat Panda, set up to safely carry the samples and the instruments, and safely store the PPE we will be using during the exploration of the sites. Another car will be available for support.</p>
      <p>Being the sites all close, we are able to easily re-schedule them depending on crowdedness, weather conditions and other unforeseen events.</p>
      <p>The base of operations will be a rented house roughly in the middle of all the exploration sites, where we will set up a small laboratory to do proper measurements and experiments while on mission.</p>
      <p>The exact locations of the sites we are going to survey are visible at this link: <a href="https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/operazione-emivita_1249984#10/44.3209/7.6094">map</a>. Please note that the exact locations could be inaccurate since the map is for travel planning purposes only, and the territory we will survey is located in the surrounding areas.</p>
